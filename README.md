mcanime2mal
===========

MCAnime to Myanimelist Exporter. It create a myanimelist xml export file that
you can import from the web interface.

It needs user input to resolve differences between names in mcanime and
myanimelist. Sometimes the OVAs or Specials are splitted in myanimelist so you
will have to add them manually later.

I have a lot of anime in my lists so it was too tedious to do it in one stand.
So i made it so you can do it little by little and when you stop the work is
saved and you can continue later.

For help run "./mcanime2mal.py --help":
